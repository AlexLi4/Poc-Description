# Poc-Description
This Project is microservice architecture based on Spring Boot framework and Spring Cloud technologies. The cloud part is using Eureka and Zuul to implement registration and route traffic service. For the Security part, I developped SSO(Single Sign On) authentication system by using Spring Security OAuth2.0 and JWT(Json Web Token). For the data retrieving part, the database is based on MySQL, and I used SpringData JPA and Hibernate to cooperate with the database. To deal with large data feeds, Apache Kafka is used to in the front-end web server tier to reduce load latency. For the UI part, Angular, AJAX and Bootstrap are used to beuatify the user interface to gain better customer experience. The whole project is deployed on AWS EC2 instance with Docker container, followed by TDD(Test Driven Development) using Junit and version control using Git.
